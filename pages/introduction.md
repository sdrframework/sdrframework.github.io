#Introduction

Welcome to the the SDR project website. SDR is an DOE ECRP 2021 award.

## Background

Lossy compression is critical to the success of today's and future scientific discovery because of the extreme volumes of data produced by scientific applications or instruments. Existing error-bounded lossy compressors, however, suffer from two significant drawbacks: (1) they support only simple error controlling (such as absolute error bound) that does not match the user's requirements for preserving quantities of interest and features; and (2) existing general-purpose data compressors are developed based on static designs without adaptability to the diverse characteristics of application datasets. 

## Goal:

The overarching goal of this project is to develop a scalable scientific data reduction (SDR) framework which integrates multiple different lossy compression models. SDR allows users to select the best-qualified data reduction solution in terms of user requirements and dynamic data characteristics, significantly improving data reduction quality and performance over the existing general-purpose lossy compressors. 

## Thruests

- SDR will use numerical analysis, machine learning, and deep learning to optimize the specific design for a broad range of data reduction techniques.

- The project will explore efficient machine learning based search algorithms to determine online the optimal data reduction solution (model and parameters). 

- The project will explore how to satisfy user-requirements (fidelity, speed, reduction ratio) efficiently and accurately. 

- SDR will support multiple parallel heterogeneous environments and will be evaluated comprehensively by using diverse scientific applications on DOE leadership-class supercomputers.
